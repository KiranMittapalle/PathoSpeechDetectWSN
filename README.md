# End-to-end pathological speech detection using Wavelet Scattering Network
The repository consists of implementation of the paper titled 'End-to-end pathological speech detection using wavelet scattering network' published in IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 2022.

Download the openly available SVD database and place the healthy and pathological speech wavefiles separately in the "database" folder and create the metadata file as specified in database/readme file.
Run "spl_2022_code.m" to implement pathological voice detection using two-layer wavelet scattering network.
